# Performance Indicator Examples

This document provides examples of Performance Indicators within the Triodian Metamodel. These examples illustrate how the Performance Indicator schema can be implemented across different business contexts to measure, track, and optimize performance metrics.

Each example includes:

- A complete Performance Indicator definition with all relevant attributes
- JSON representation following the schema structure
- Explanation of the indicator's purpose and implementation considerations

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these Performance Indicators within the Triodian Metamodel, organizations should consider:

1. **Integration with Strategic Response Model**:
   - Link performance indicators to specific strategic responses to triggers
   - Ensure indicators provide measurable criteria for evaluating strategic effectiveness
   - Use the temporal aspects (immediate, intermediate, long-term) to track progress over time

2. **Alignment with Business Domains**:
   - Connect indicators to relevant domains such as Capabilities, Value Streams, and Stakeholders
   - Ensure indicators support organizational objectives across multiple time horizons
   - Leverage leading indicators to provide early warning signals

3. **Measurement Approach Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate combinations of objective, subjective, and proxy measures
   - Balance the need for accuracy with implementation feasibility
   - Consider data collection overhead and automation opportunities

4. **Continuous Evolution**:
   - Regularly evaluate potential metrics for implementation
   - Update thresholds and targets based on organizational learning
   - Refine measurement approaches as capabilities mature

These examples demonstrate how the Performance Indicator schema enables sophisticated performance management practices that align with the Triodian Metamodel's approach to business architecture.
