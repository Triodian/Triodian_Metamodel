# Examples of Trigger and Rationale Links

This page provides examples of how Triggers and Rationales are used within the Triodian Metamodel to document the drivers of change and the justification for responses across different business domains.

Each example includes:

- A specific Trigger (external or internal)
- The Rationale for responding
- The Affected Domain(s)
- A sample JSON structure linking the trigger to a rationale, in the Strategic Response Model's composite form (`triggers` and `rationales` lists), checked against `strategic-response-model.schema.json` by `scripts/validate.py`
